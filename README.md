> **Important Note**: This is a significantly improved Linux fork of [Fus3n's gem-assist](https://github.com/Fus3n/gem-assist) with numerous enhancements, bug fixes, and new features to make it fully functional on Linux systems.

Gem-assist-linux is a powerful terminal-based AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini models. It employs a unique two-phase reasoning architecture along with an expanded toolset to provide intelligent assistance directly in your terminal.

## üîÑ Fork Improvements

This Linux fork provides substantial improvements over the original project:

- **Two-Phase Reasoning Architecture**: Added a completely new reasoning-before-execution approach
- **Enhanced Terminal UI**: Improved console interaction and display formatting
- **Extended Tool Set**: Added numerous new tools including arXiv research paper integration
- **YouTube Transcript Analysis**: Added capability to extract and analyze video content
- **Improved Web Content Extraction**: Better handling of complex websites and content extraction
- **Research Tools**: New tools for scholarly research and academic paper analysis
- **Linux Compatibility**: Fixed various issues that prevented proper functionality on Linux systems
- **Comprehensive System Information**: Enhanced system information collection and reporting

## üåü Key Features

- **Two-Phase Reasoning**: Planning before execution ensures thoughtful and strategic responses
- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: 30+ specialized tools for file operations, web searches, code execution, and more
- **Research Capabilities**: Direct access to academic papers through arXiv integration
- **YouTube Analysis**: Extract and analyze video transcripts
- **Efficient Web Strategy**: Smart search tools to avoid rate limits while maximizing information quality
- **Local File Access**: Read and manipulate various file types including PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files
- **Customizable**: Easy configuration through a central config.py file

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Gem-assist-linux uses a deliberate two-phase approach to solve problems:

1. **Reasoning Phase**: The assistant first analyzes the query and plans an approach
2. **Execution Phase**: The assistant follows the reasoning plan to execute tools and provide a final response

> **Note**: The architecture diagrams below will render properly on GitHub and GitLab. In other environments, you'll see the diagram code instead.

    end
    
    FinalResponse --> User
```

### Core Components

The assistant consists of several interconnected components that work together:

- **Assistant**: Central coordinator that manages the conversation
- **MessageProcessor**: Handles conversation flow and message processing
- **ReasoningEngine**: Plans approach without executing tools
- **ToolExecutor**: Executes tools according to the reasoning plan
- **SessionManager**: Manages conversation history and persistence
- **Tool Collection**: Library of 30+ specialized tools across categories

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (for dependency management)
- Google Gemini API key ([get one here](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DragonL57/gem-assist-linux.git
   cd gem-assist-linux
   ```

2. **Install core dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Install optional dependencies** (based on your needs):
   ```bash
   # For all optional dependencies
   uv pip install -e ".[all]"
   
   # Or install specific feature groups
   uv pip install -e ".[data-analysis,web-scraping,dynamic-web,documents]"
   ```

4. **Configure API keys**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   REDDIT_ID=your_reddit_client_id  # Optional
   REDDIT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret  # Optional
   ```

## üìã Usage

Run the main script to start the chat interface:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

You'll see a chat interface where you can interact with the assistant. The conversation follows this workflow:

1. You ask a question
2. The assistant develops an approach plan (Reasoning Phase)
3. The assistant displays its reasoning
4. The assistant executes relevant tools (Execution Phase)
5. The assistant synthesizes all information and provides a comprehensive response

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Assistant
    participant Tools
    
    User->>Assistant: Ask a question
    Note over Assistant: Reasoning Phase
    Assistant->>Assistant: Develop approach plan
    Assistant-->>User: Display reasoning
    Note over Assistant: Execution Phase
    Assistant->>Tools: Execute relevant tools
    Tools-->>Assistant: Return results
    Assistant->>Assistant: Synthesize final answer
    Assistant-->>User: Provide comprehensive response
```

### Commands

- `/exit` or `/quit` - Exit the chat
- `/save [name]` - Save the current session
- `/load [name]` - Load a saved session
- `/reset` - Reset the current session
